# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
1. Connecting to CityBikes API
2. Connecting to Foursquare and Yelp APIs
3. Joining Data
4. Building a Model
5. Interpret results
## Process
Step 1: Import libraries for making request.loading and displaying data i.e. request, pandas.
Step 2: Search the city bikes api for city of interest - chicago
Step 3: Search for relavant information i.e. number of bikes, station information.
Step 4: Search for restaurants and poi around the stations using the foursquare and yelp apis.
Step 5: clean the datasets and join using pandas and sqlite
Step 6: Create database to store all tables

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)
The result I was able to get was EDA of the datasets. I was able to build regression model 

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
The obvious challenge was extracting poi from the apis

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
I will recommend with have assistance active on weekends of the project. There are some many gray areas that needs clarification and guidance.
